Design System Language: Examples
================================

The following is a list of example screens and their description.

Login Screen
---
A login screen is a user interface element that is used to authenticate a user's identity before granting them access to a digital application or service. Typically, a login screen consists of the following elements:

	- A header or logo: This is usually located at the top of the screen and displays the name and/or logo of the application or service being accessed.
	- A username or email field: This is where the user enters their username or email address, which is used to identify their account.
	- A password field: This is where the user enters their password, which is used to verify their identity.
	- A "forgot password" link: This is a link that allows users to reset their password if they have forgotten it.
	- A "login" button: This is the button that the user clicks to submit their login credentials and access the application or service.
	- A "register" link: This is a link that allows new users to create an account if they don't already have one.
	- An error message: This is a message that appears if the user enters incorrect login credentials or encounters an error during the login process.

In terms of design, a login screen should be simple and easy to use. The elements should be clearly labeled and easy to navigate, and the overall aesthetic should be in keeping with the design language of the application or service being accessed. Additionally, the login screen should be designed with security in mind, and should include measures like password masking and two-factor authentication to protect the user's account.

User Profile
---
A user profile screen is a user interface element that displays information about a user, such as their personal details, preferences, and activity within an application or service. Typically, a user profile screen consists of the following elements:

	- A profile photo: This is an image that represents the user and is often displayed at the top of the screen.
	- Personal details: This section displays the user's name, email address, and other personal information such as their location, job title, or bio.
	- User activity: This section displays the user's activity within the application or service, such as their recent posts, comments, or purchases.
	- Preferences: This section displays the user's preferences, such as their notification settings, theme, or language.
	- Edit profile button: This is a button that allows the user to edit their personal details, profile photo, or preferences.
	- Change password button: This is a button that allows the user to change their password.
	- Logout button: This is a button that allows the user to log out of the application or service.

In terms of design, a user profile screen should be visually appealing and easy to navigate. The elements should be logically arranged and easy to understand, with clear labels and intuitive icons. Additionally, the design should be consistent with the overall design language of the application or service, and should be optimized for readability and accessibility. The user profile screen should also be designed with privacy in mind, with sensitive information protected and secure.

A create bill screen is a user interface element that is used to generate a bill that includes a QR code. Typically, a create bill screen consists of the following elements:

	- Bill details: This section displays the details of the bill, such as the amount, due date, and payment method.

	- QR code: This is a two-dimensional barcode that is used to facilitate the payment of the bill.
	- Generate bill button: This is a button that is used to generate the bill with the QR code.

In terms of design, a create bill screen should be intuitive and easy to use, with clear labels and simple visuals. The elements should be logically arranged and easy to understand, with a focus on user experience. Additionally, the create bill screen should be optimized for mobile devices, with the QR code easily scannable by a smartphone camera.
